# Installapalooza

We're going to install most of the tools we'll use at Learners Guild onto your computer.

Please follow the setup instructions in each of these guides:

1. Setup your **Development Environment**:
    - [General Command Line Tools](environment-setup)
    - [Node.js and Express Stack](environment-setup/node-express-stack.md)
2. Install **Development Tools & Applications**:
    - [Text Editor](mac-dev-tools/README.md#text-editor)
    - [Browser](mac-dev-tools/README.md#browser)
    - [Window Manager](mac-dev-tools/README.md#window-manager)
    - [Learn Keyboard Shortcuts](mac-dev-tools/README.md#a-word-on-keyboard-shortcuts)

*In this context, "stack" refers to a group of technologies used together to create a web app.*

If you are unsure what to do or run into problems during installation, don't worry! It happens to every web developer at some point. Read any error messages, recheck the instructions, and ask for help.
